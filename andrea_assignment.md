## What is the difference between the push, pull, and fetch Git commands?

When you share and update projects using Git, you’ll use some or all of the following commands:

- `git pull` - Update a remote repository with changes from your local repository.
- `git fetch` - Download changes from a remote repository to your local repository without merging them.
- `git push` - Download changes from a remote repository and then merge them into your local repository.

It’s important to understand what each command does so that you can choose the right command for the right task.

The `git pull` command downloads changes from a remote repository and then merges them into your local repository. Internally, the `git pull` command runs `git fetch` followed immediately by `git merge`, or `git rebase` if you use the `--rebase` flag.

Some people prefer to use `git fetch` followed by `git merge` to make sure they understand the changes they are merging into their branch before the merge happens.`git fetch` again takes your current branch, and checks to see if there is a tracking branch. If so, it looks for changes in the remote branch, and pulls them into the tracking branch. It does not change your local branch. To do that, you'll need to do `git merge origin/main` (for the "main" branch) to merge those changes into your branch - probably also called "main".

The `git push` command updates a remote branch with changes from your local branch. Run `git pull --rebase` before running `git push` to make sure your local branch is up-to-date with the remote branch. If there are merge conflicts, then you can resolve them before you push your changes to the remote branch.
